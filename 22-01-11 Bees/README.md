The first time taking part in TidyTuesday and first time trying to make a map with ggplot2. 

I ended up making a simple map showing the number of bee colonies (October to December) in each state on the US mainland between 2015 and 2020.

While this visualisation does not suggest a large change in bee colony numbers in most states, it offered me a good introduction into the ggplot2 map options and using the vidris scales.
