This week's tidyTuesday all about chocolate and I have made my first gif using ggplot. 

The gif shows a simple bargraph showing the mean rating (scale 1-5) by cocoa percentage of Chocolate - the gif shows ths graph throughout the year 2006 to 2021.

The visualisation shows not only the rating throught the years (which don't suggest any clear pattern throughout the years), but also what chocolates were rated within the dataset.
